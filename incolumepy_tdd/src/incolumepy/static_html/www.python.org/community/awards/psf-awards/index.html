<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id1">Introduction</a></h1>
<p><a class="reference external" href="/psf/">The Python Software Foundation</a> relies on volunteer efforts
to achieve many of its goals.  The PSF Community Service Awards are a formal
way for the PSF Board of Directors to offer recognition of work which,
in its opinion, significantly improves the Foundation's fulfillment of
its mission and benefits the broader Python community.  The intention
of these awards is to demonstrate that service to the Python community
does lead to recognition and reward, rather than to provide a direct
incentive to contributors.</p>
<p>Awards will be made periodically, normally every three months,
although the Board may choose to consider awards at other times.  Any
PSF member is entitled to propose an award at any time, stating the
reasons for which the award is merited.  Proposals should be made
confidentially to the Board by sending email to <a class="reference external" href="mailto:psf&#64;python.org">psf&#64;python.org</a>.</p>
<p>The minutes of award considerations will not name the individuals
concerned unless an award is made.  The Board will contact proposers
to keep them informed of the status of their proposals (such as when
the proposal will receive Board consideration).</p>
<p>In the event that more than one award is proposed in a given period
the Board may elect to hold over a proposal.  Awards will be
considered in the order in which they are received.</p>
<p>While it would be unusual for a single individual to receive multiple
awards, repeated awards will be appropriate to acknowledge ongoing
contributions.  Recipients need not be Foundation members (though
receiving an award may be an indication that consideration for
membership is appropriate).</p>
<p>Recognition will take the form of an award certificate plus one of the
following:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>A cash award of $500, allowing a single award to a US
taxpayer to be made without requiring any formalities; or</li>
<li>Free registration at PyCon, with optionally a contribution of up to
$500 towards the recipient's travel and accommodation expenses.
This award would be preferred for recipients from outside the USA,
as there are fewer tax implications.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Board should consider awards at any quarterly meeting where a
member award proposal has been received since the last award
consideration.  At each such meeting where no proposal has been
received within the preceding three months the Board may, at its
discretion, make an award to an individual nominated by the Board.</p>

within 2 years of written notification, the award expires.</p>

<li>The Q3 2019 Community Service Award went to <strong>Mannie Young</strong> for being a humble and thoughtful leader, being an Executive Committee member for PyCon Africa, and for being a leader for Python Ghana. Mannie worked tirelessly to make sure PyCon Africa was a successful event by traveling to Accra several times to work on conference planning and was behind all of the conference design and social media activities for the event.</li>
<li>The Q3 2019 Community Service Award went to <strong>Katie Bell</strong> for her work on PyCon AU as Co-Chair, her contributions in the years before her time as chair to PyCon AU, and helper/keynote/speaker at previous KiwiPyCons. She has also worked exceptionally hard participating in the incident reporting team at PyCon AU 2018 and 2019. This has stood as a go-to example for other conferences in the region, including feeding back into the PyCon Conduct process. She has also been the main person implementing on-site childcare at PyCon AU 2018 &amp; 2019, which has also been an example for other conferences.</li>
<li>The Q3 2019 Community Service Award went to <strong>Lillian Ryan</strong> for her work on PyCon AU as Papers Chair, and her contribution as speaker/keynote to a number of PyCons and DjangoCons. She has also worked extraordinarily hard behind the scenes to implement anonymous proposal submissions for PyCon AU. This effort has enabled PyCon AU to reduce bias in the conference proposal process, and has stood as an example for other conferences.</li>
<li>The Q3 2019 Community Service Award went to <strong>Jessica Upani</strong> for being one of the most active members of PyCon Namibia, as well as the Conference Chair. As a high school mathematics teacher in Namibia, Jessica is bringing Python into the community in several ways such as promoting Python as a language to universities and also helping build out a variety of Python programming in her community for young people (eg PyNam Scholars). Jessica also is a prominent Python speaker having most recently spoke at PyCon Africa.</li>

<li>The Q2 2019 Community Service Award went to <strong>Felipe de Morais</strong> for his work towards facilitating the growth of the Python Brazilian community by organizing workshops, contributing to open source code that benefits the Brazilian people and for setting an example for all community organizers.</li>
<li>The Q1 2019 Community Service Award also went to <strong>Chris Angelico</strong> for his work towards fostering the online Python community by helping maintain the pydotorg-www mailing list, helping community members get edit access to the public facing Python wiki, and also for being an active contributor to python-ideas mailing list and the python-dev mailing list.</li>

<li>The Q1 2019 Community Service Award went to <strong>Stefan Behnel</strong> for his work as the main developer and maintainer of two important Python projects: Cython and lxml. Stefan forked off Pyrex and started Cython almost 11 years ago. Cython makes writing and maintain a C extension or C library bindings simple. It plays a vital role in the numeric and scientific community, too. Without Cython, Python 3 adoption would have taken much longer. Cython hides much of the Python 2 / 3 C-API differences from the developer. <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/Cython/">https://pypi.org/project/Cython/</a> lxml is the fastest and most feature rich XML parsing, transforming and querying package for Python. It's also commonly used to parse HTML. <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/lxml/">https://pypi.org/project/lxml/</a> Stefan has been maintaining these two important libraries for over a decade. He is also a regular speaker at conferences and very helpful on the mailing lists.</li>
<li>The Q1 2019 Community Service Award also went to <strong>Eric Ma</strong> for going above and beyond in his responsibilities as PyCon's Financial Aid Co-Chair for two years and this year stepping up to be Chair. Additionally, Eric has been a dedicated PyCon Program Committee member for several years.</li>

blog post</a>):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Matthew Dixon Cowles</strong>: Matthew has been a tireless (and
unfailingly polite) responder to the many users of <a class="reference external" href="http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-help">the python-help
mailing list</a>, used by
those seeking assistance not readily available through other
channels. This assistance covers not only elementary questions but
also quite advanced ones. Matthew has been a member of the Python
community for many years, patiently answering questions and
enlightening those who seek to get more out of the Python language.</li>
<li><strong>Brad Knowles</strong>: Brad has managed the python.org e-mail since I can
remember, and it's down to him that our lists and newsgroups are so
blissfully free of spam. It's hard to appreciate the sheer volume of
mail that Brad handles, and he is fiercely defensive of our domain's
status on the Internet. Keeping the e-mail flowing is essential not
just to the PSF but also to all the users of mailing lists and
newsgroups. Brad does all this not because he is a big Python user,
but because it needs to be done. This is the community service ethic
at its best.</li>
<li><strong>Peter Kropf</strong> and <strong>Martin Thomas</strong>: Peter and Martin are probably
best known to those people who want to employ Python programmers, as
they have jointly been almost the sole workforce behind <a class="reference external" href="/community/jobs/">the Python
Job Board</a> for the last several years. The fact
that the Job Board exists, and is available free of charge to anyone
looking to hire people with Python skills, is possibly more central
to Python's rise in popularity than we appreciate. PyCon chairman
David Goodger paid tribute to the Job Board as helping him out of
unemployment in his opening remarks this year, and I know there are
dozens if not hundreds of others who should be similarly grateful to
Peter and Martin.</li>
